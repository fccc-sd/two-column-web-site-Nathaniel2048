                    My name is Nathan. I was born in 2007 in Defiance Ohio. 
                    I used to go to Tinora schools before I came to Four County. 
                    I decided to come out to Four County for computer programming with <a href="https://mrgeiger.com/" title="Link to Mr. Geiger's site">Mr. Geiger</a> since I really enjoy video games. 
                    Every since I was a kid I have been playing video games. 
                    I decided that since I enjoy them so much I should get a job working with them.
                    I also figured that even if I changed my mind and did not want to program games 
                    anymore that it would still be cool to understand how they were made in a more detailed way.
                    Someday tho for right now I want to get a job in quality assurence beta testing games.
